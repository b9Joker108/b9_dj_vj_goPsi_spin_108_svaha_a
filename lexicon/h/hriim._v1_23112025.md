### Triangulation and Contextual Support

1. **Empirical Scriptural and Tantric Sources**:  
   - The syllable **"ह्रीं" (Hrīṁ)** is considered the **shakti-beejam** (seed of power) syllable linked with the **Goddess Yogamaya** or yogic māyā in the Sri Vidya and Shakta traditions. This bija is acknowledged as representing the concentrated divine energy embodying **purity, transformation, and auspiciousness**[1][2].
   - It appears prominently in **Sri Vidya Upasana** and related mantric practices, where Hrīṁ invokes the creative and transformative power of the goddess as the mediator of cosmic illusion and liberation[3].

2. **Philosophical and Theological Significance**:  
   - Hrīṁ symbolizes the **"Hrimkara,"** the sound-form encapsulating the divine feminine energy responsible for both concealment and revelation within cosmic processes. It is seen as the **essence of Yogamaya’s power** to veil and unveil reality, aligning with her role described in Vaishnavism and Tantric literature[4][3][5].

3. **Mantric Usage in Devotional Hymns**:  
   - Chanting **"Om Hrīṁ Yogamāyāya Namaha"** is a common mantric homage, where the bija encapsulates Yogamaya’s essence, purifying the mind and aligning it with divine will and cosmic order[2][6].
