https://youtu.be/veRywDwsFLs?si=zacR6s7Sfm9ICbTV   Tell me everything you can about this track: DIG!

This is **“It Talks / It Walks” by Noogman**, a cult deep/tech house cut from an obscure early‑2000s Dutch 12". [1][2]

## Basic release data

- Artist: **Noogman**. [2]
- Title (EP): **Untitled**. [1][2]
- Key track: **“It Talks / It Walks”** (sometimes written “It Talks / It Walks – Noogman”). [1][3][2]
- Label: **Polylux Records** – catalog **PL001**. [1][2]
- Format: 12" vinyl only. [1][2]
- Country: Netherlands. [1][2]
- Year: **2002**. [1][2]
- Styles: **Deep House / Tech House / House**, often tagged “deep tech house”. [1][3][4]

On the 12", “It Talks / It Walks” is one of (at least) two tracks, the other being “Believer.” [1][5]

## Sonic and sample character

- Length on uploads: about **7:33**. [2]
- Central vocal sample: a spoken‑word description of a ritual drum — “this is the drum that brings the good spirit to possess you or drives away the bad spirit… it talks, it laughs, it cries, it warns…”. [2]
- The track locks this into a **hypnotic, shamanic loop**, matching the description in the sample (“creates a hypnotic influence over its listeners”) with the production aesthetic: rolling, minimally arranged, late‑night deep/tech house. [2]
- Structure: long DJ‑friendly intro and outro, steady 4/4 groove, with the vocal riding on top in cycles rather than a conventional verse/chorus song form. [2]

The Blind_Digger upload you linked explicitly flags that all uploads are low‑bitrate (128 kbps), so the original vinyl will sound fuller than the YouTube rip. [2][6]

## Scene status and digger lore

- The record has become a **sought‑after diggers’ item**: a Revibed pre‑order page shows high demand vs. relatively low ownership (Discogs‑style stats: ~148 have, ~1798 want; 4.4/5 rating from 65 votes). [1]
- It’s circulating in **“dig of the week”** and “last dig of the month” type reels on Instagram, clearly canonized as a headsy deep‑tech sleeper from the Netherlands. [3][7][4]
- Multiple uploads (Lucas Wave, Blind_Digger, others) treat it as an archetypal **deep, hypnotic, drum‑centric tech house** tool — the sort of record you’d keep for late‑night sets or intimate floors. [2][6]

## Discographic context

- Catalog: **Polylux PL001** appears to be the first (or one of the first) releases on Polylux Records, positioning Noogman right at the label’s inception. [1][2]
- Companion track: **“Believer”** shares the same EP and stylistic space; it’s often uploaded separately with the same metadata (Polylux Records – PL001, Netherlands, 2002, deep/tech house). [1][5]

In short: you’re dealing with an early‑2000s Dutch deep/tech house grail — **Noogman’s “It Talks / It Walks”**, a vinyl‑only, shamanic drum‑vocal roller on Polylux that has quietly become a prized dig for contemporary deep‑tech heads. [1][3][2][4]

Any intell on the origin of vocal sample?

I have not been able to locate any reliable documentation that identifies the **source** of that vocal sample; it appears to be **uncredited and currently untraced**.  

A few points that can be said with confidence:

- The speech content – “this is the drum that brings the good spirit to possess you or drives away the bad spirit… it talks, it laughs, it cries, it warns…” – strongly suggests an **ethnographic / documentary or educational voice‑over** about ritual drum use, rather than something written specifically for the track.  
- There is **no widely cited film, TV show, or famous documentary** that is consistently named in DJ forums or collector chatter as the origin of this exact sample; unlike very famous “go‑to” sample sources (e.g., well‑known movies), this one does not have a recognized provenance in the scene.  
- The track is from an **obscure early‑2000s Dutch 12″** on a small label, which increases the likelihood that Noogman sampled from a relatively niche **VHS / documentary / educational audio** or a library record, rather than from a mainstream film whose quotes would be instantly recognized and catalogued.  

Given what’s publicly traceable right now, the honest state of play is: **people know *that* the sample exists and quote it, but no one has definitively pinned its original source** in accessible discographical or crate‑digger discourse. To push further you’d likely need:  

- A much higher‑quality rip to do **forensic listening** for room tone / tape hiss / background cues.  
- Systematic manual trawling through 1970s–1990s ethnographic film on African, Afro‑Caribbean, or Afro‑diasporic drumming, and/or educational records on “talking drums”.  
- Or, best of all, direct contact with the producer or people connected to Polylux to ask where they lifted it from.  

If you want, I can sketch a very concrete search strategy (keywords, archive types, and eras to check) that would maximize your odds of actually identifying the documentary or record.
