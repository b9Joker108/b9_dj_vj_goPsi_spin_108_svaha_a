For my soon to commence YouTube upload campaign I need to apprise myself of SOTA FOSS VJ applications on GNU/Linux and SOTA sophisticated sovereign FOSS video editing, stylistics, remixology, input masks and other sophisticated mystical Process Art magico-intentional post-processing mechanisms, techniques and modalities. Triangulate and report.

For your YouTube upload campaign focusing on sophisticated sovereign Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) video mixing, editing, and post-processing on GNU/Linux, here is a triangulated and up-to-date overview of state-of-the-art (SOTA) tools and techniques relevant to VJing, process art, magico-intentional remixology, and advanced stylistics.

## SOTA FOSS VJ Applications on GNU/Linux

1. **VLMC (VideoLan Movie Creator)**
   - Derived from the VLC project, VLMC is aimed at non-linear video editing but includes live mixing capacities with simplicity and reliability.
   - Supports multiple input sources and real-time material processing; suitable for experimental VJ workflows.

2. **VidCutter + OBS Studio**
   - Combined use of lightweight clip selection (VidCutter) with real-time compositing and streaming (OBS) is common.
   - OBS Studio on GNU/Linux supports plugins for effects and transitions enabling live video remixing, though primarily a streamer.

3. **Mixxx + Video Plugins**
   - Mixxx is traditionally an audio DJ software, but experimental integration with video plugins or external video engines allows rudimentary VJ application.
   - Requires pairing with screen/projector outputs and specialized video routing with JACK or PulseAudio bridging.

4. **Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) with Shader Plugins**
   - OBS supports sophisticated **shader effects, chromakey, LUTs**, and compositing, invisible integration of multiple video layers, and advanced mask and blending methods.
   - Cross-platform stability and FOSS licensing.

5. **GLVid (OpenGL Video Mixing) and MPV (with scripting)**
   - GLVid or custom OpenGL shader-based players provide GPU-accelerated VJing with real-time video manipulation.
   - MPV can be scripted for complex layering and masking workflows.

6. **TidalCycles and Hydra (for visuals)**
   - Though TidalCycles is for live coding music, Hydra is a browser-based livecoded video synthesis platform compatible with Linux browsers providing shader-based interactive visuals.
   - Great for esoteric magico-intentional visuals tied to musical inputs.

7. **CLaSH and Quartz Composer (Linux equivalents)**
   - While Quartz Composer is macOS-only, Linux alternatives include **CLaSH**, an FPGA-based synthesis environment, allowing generative video synthesis and live VJ performance.
   - Used mostly in research contexts or with experimental hardware.

## SOTA FOSS Video Editing and Remixology Tools

1. **Kdenlive**
   - Feature-rich, non-linear video editor, supports multitrack editing with numerous effects, transitions, and professional color grading.
   - Scripting support via MLT framework and XML project files facilitates advanced workflows and process art pipelines.

2. **Shotcut**
   - Cross-platform, intuitive, with extensive support for video filters, compositing, and real-time preview.
   - Supports video scopes and LUTs, useful for colorist work and precise stylistic control.

3. **Olive Video Editor**
   - Emerging project with sophisticated UI, intended for advanced professional use.
   - Feature roadmap includes sophisticated keyframing, masking, roto, and blending modes indispensable for process art.

4. **Blender’s Video Sequence Editor (VSE)**
   - Blender offers professional-grade compositing, 3D integration, and video editing.
   - Supports node-based compositing, mask creation, advanced rotoscoping, and scriptable post-processing, ideal for bespoke magico-intentional video art.

5. **Natron**
   - Compositing software inspired by Adobe After Effects.
   - Node-based filters, masks, and chroma-keying provide a sophisticated environment for layered video remixology and ritualistic visual effects.

## Sophisticated Process Art and Magico-Intentional Video Post-Processing Modalities

- **Node-based Compositing and Masking:** (Natron, Blender VSE)  
  Enable granular control over layering, alpha channels, and dynamic masking to create temporal transformations and ritual-like overlays.

- **Real-Time Shader Effects and GLSL Programming:** (OBS shader plugins, Hydra)  
  Custom GLSL shaders and livecoded visual synthesis empower shape-shifting, fractal morphing, and organic transformations keyed to input audio or controls.

- **Generative and Algorithmic Video Systems:** (TidalCycles + Hydra, custom OpenGL/GLSL, CLaSH FPGA synthesis)  
  Use of generative algorithms, sampling, and real-time parameter manipulation facilitates ecstatic audiovisual ritual, mimicking shamanic or trance-inducing imagery.

- **Multisensory Input Masks and Layered Sound-Visualizer Coupling:**  
  Advanced tools integrate motion capture, MIDI controllers, and OSC signals to modulate video processing parameters. This increases magico-intentionality by converting physical or sonic gestures into sacramental enactments.

- **AI-Assisted Style Transfer and Remediation:**  
  Emerging pipelines use AI models for real-time style transfer across videos, offering new process art depths rooted in imbuing videos with painterly or esoteric aesthetics.
