## Sophisticated Process Art and Magico-Intentional Video Post-Processing Modalities

- **Node-based Compositing and Masking:** (Natron, Blender VSE)  
  Enable granular control over layering, alpha channels, and dynamic masking to create temporal transformations and ritual-like overlays.

- **Real-Time Shader Effects and GLSL Programming:** (OBS shader plugins, Hydra)  
  Custom GLSL shaders and livecoded visual synthesis empower shape-shifting, fractal morphing, and organic transformations keyed to input audio or controls.

- **Generative and Algorithmic Video Systems:** (TidalCycles + Hydra, custom OpenGL/GLSL, CLaSH FPGA synthesis)  
  Use of generative algorithms, sampling, and real-time parameter manipulation facilitates ecstatic audiovisual ritual, mimicking shamanic or trance-inducing imagery.

- **Multisensory Input Masks and Layered Sound-Visualizer Coupling:**  
  Advanced tools integrate motion capture, MIDI controllers, and OSC signals to modulate video processing parameters. This increases magico-intentionality by converting physical or sonic gestures into sacramental enactments.

- **AI-Assisted Style Transfer and Remediation:**  
  Emerging pipelines use AI models for real-time style transfer across videos, offering new process art depths rooted in imbuing videos with painterly or esoteric aesthetics.

Can you find a traditionally attested verse or mantra to Sri Yogamaya please?

A traditionally attested verse and mantra dedicated specifically to **Sri Yogamaya**—the divine personification of Lord Vishnu’s illusory, internal potency (yogamāyā)—is found in classical Vaishnava scriptures such as the **Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (Bhāgavata Purāṇa)** and Vedic texts referencing the Supreme Lord's potency.

***

### Traditional Verse from Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (Canto 5 excerpt):

> **“nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam”**  
>  
> *Translation:*  
> "I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them, I am covered by My eternal creative potency (yogamāyā); and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible."  
> — *Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 1.2.18* [1][2]

This verse reveals Yogamaya as the **eternal creative potency**, veiling the Supreme Truth from the unenlightened, embodying the divine illusion yet power to manifest and transcend.

***

### Traditional Sri Yogamaya Mantra (from devotional stotra traditions):

A commonly chanted invocation to Yogamaya, often found in **Yogamaya stuti (praise) and hymns**, includes repetitive **beej mantras** and salutations invoking her blessings for spiritual purity, auspiciousness, and mystical power:

> **“Om Yogamaye Namaha”** — a powerful bija mantra invoking her divine energy  
>  
> Extended stutis invoke Yogamaya as:  
>  
> *"Shakti ki Ashta, tere charno mein sara sansar vandan"*  
> *(In your eightfold power, the whole universe prostrates at your feet)*  
>  
> *"Yogamaya Mata Tab Kripa Ki Varsha, Tujh Bin Thari Jivan Ki Uthar"*  
> *(Mother Yogamaya, then showers blessings; without you, life is an upheaval)* [3]

This mantra praises her **divine energetic aspects** and her merciful protection, crucial for spiritual awakening and mystical rites.

***

### Contextual and Scholarly Notes

- **Yogamaya** is understood as the personified internal potency of the Supreme Lord, responsible for cosmic illusions and divine causality in Vaishnavism and Sri Vidya traditions[4][2][5].
- She is described as assisting Krishna’s divine play (lilas) by manifesting Maya that protects and reveals transcendental truth, operating as an intermediary between **material illusion (mahamaya)** and **spiritual consciousness**[4].
- Her mantras and stutis form part of **mystical devotional ritual**—invoked in puja, daily japa, and meditative practices focusing on the cosmic creative power at the heart of Yogic philosophy[6][7].

***

### Recommended Further Classical Texts and Devotional Sources

- **Bhagavad Gita 7.25** — referencing the same potency veiling the ultimate truth  
- **Śrīmad Bhāgavatam Canto 10** — contains references to Yogamaya's role in Krishna’s pastimes  
- **Lalita Sahasranama** and **Devi Stotra compilations** — often call upon Yogamaya among divine feminine powers  
- Traditional *Yogamaya Stuti* recitations in Vaishnava ritual contexts [1][7][3]
