### Monday, November 24, 2025 ~ '```src|Re```' ###

In regards to the illuminations of the Illuminati, we did not cover fundamental archival practices of visual source material and which FOSS apps furnish this function and curate a deepdive into what defines and constitutes each tooling? I feel there needs to be a way to tag, sort and discover and employ and to afford rapid ease in live-mixing with finesse, technique, style and mixology. So, we need to identify the set of definite features and how to distill and apply them to source visuals as a combinatory pallette and texture and the kinds of transformations and integrations each artefact is on-point for?

> I have not yet used all these applications and tools. I will investigate, excavate and interrogate and \\|/push-the-envelo[P](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wynn&oldid=1319860583)e\\|/ with each of them to ascertain \\|/[L](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Laguz&oldid=1297058305)ay-of-the-lan[D](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dagaz&oldid=1265470562)\\|/ and then ride possibility into the presently \\|/un[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kaunan&oldid=1256638848)nowable\\|/.

***

### Application to a Combinatory Palette and Texture

- **Tagging as Thematic Anchors:** Use namespaces to tag visual motifs (e.g., “Illumination,” “Sovereignty,” “Sacral Geometry”).
- **Sorting as Ritual Selection:** Filtering by tags to bone up ritual sets or palettes directly during live performances.
- **Mixing as Magico-Intentional Practice:** Overlay, fade, loop, and modulate visuals, images, and text to create a living ritual field with precise timing and interaction.
- **Transformation as Meaning-Making:** Color grading, distortions, spatial positioning, and dynamic masking allow symbolic reinterpretation and layering of meaning.
- **Integration as Multi-Sensorial Synthesis:** Combine archival quality visuals with synchronized audio and textual annotations, leveraging scripting engines in tools like Snowmix or Kdenlive.

***

### Proposed Integrated Workflow

1. **Curate & Tag** all source visuals in Darktable or via filesystem tagging in Dolphin or Fossology.
2. **Automate metadata extraction** with Exiftool for enhanced searchability and provenance.
3. **Prepare and edit** selected content in Kdenlive or Shotcut with standard video effects and compositing.
4. **Live-mix ritual session** using Snowmix, uniquely controlled via scripts or external controllers to transform archives into evolving ritual illumination.
5. **Document and version** the session and materials to maintain archival integrity and enable future blendings.

Is there science on visual illumunations that make people want to dance?

Yes, there is robust scientific research on how visual illuminations can motivate and induce dance. Key findings across neuroscience, psychology, and event design include:

- **Visual rhythms and dance motivation:** Structured dance movements visually mimic musical rhythms, allowing observers to tune visually to beat patterns and subdivisions. This visual metrical perception engages sensorimotor coupling circuits, similar to auditory rhythm processing, creating an embodied impulse to move and dance [1].

- **Light and mood influence:** Dynamic lighting, especially in rave and dance club settings, acts as a mood booster. Sequenced flashing lights and color patterns can synchronize brainwaves, elevating energy and enhancing the collective sense of connection and euphoria on the dance floor. This bio-psychological entrainment increases motivation to dance [2].

- **Psychology of dance floor lighting:** Color, brightness, and changing patterns in lighting affect emotional responses and social behaviors, such as reducing anxiety, promoting social interactions, and stimulating physical energy. Warm colors (reds, ambers) tend to increase energy and intimacy, while blues have calming effects. Strategic lighting design significantly enhances dance floor engagement and guest participation [3].

- **Neuroscientific frameworks:** Studies review how dance movements and visual stimuli activate neural circuits related to rhythm perception, movement planning, and motor resonance. Visual input reflecting natural dance movement patterns simulates internal motor processes reinforcing rhythmic engagement and dance motivation [4][5].

**Purport:** This English Wikipedia article was created, populated and cited by me and hasn't changed significantly from my foundational finesse. When I first created it, I wrote and populated it from my general knowledge for circa twenty (20) hours straight, whilst in a trance. I have had an enduring interest in trance induction and trance induction modalities. One of my personal heroes is the luminary [Erickson](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milton_H._Erickson&oldid=1299500123).

**Personal Note: My trance induction powerpoints are to be on-point.**

Can you find a traditionally attested verse or mantra to Sri Yogamaya please?

A traditionally attested verse and mantra dedicated specifically to **Sri Yogamaya**—the divine personification of Lord Vishnu’s illusory, internal potency (yogamāyā)—is found in classical Vaishnava scriptures such as the **Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (Bhāgavata Purāṇa)** and Vedic texts referencing the Supreme Lord's potency.

***

### Traditional Verse from Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (Canto 5 excerpt):

> **“nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam”**  
>  
> *Translation:*  
> "I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them, I am covered by My eternal creative potency (yogamāyā); and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible."  
> — *Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 1.2.18* [1][2]

This verse reveals Yogamaya as the **eternal creative potency**, veiling the Supreme Truth from the unenlightened, embodying the divine illusion yet power to manifest and transcend.

***

### Traditional Sri Yogamaya Mantra (from devotional stotra traditions):

A commonly chanted invocation to Yogamaya, often found in **Yogamaya stuti (praise) and hymns**, includes repetitive **beej mantras** and salutations invoking her blessings for spiritual purity, auspiciousness, and mystical power:

> **“Om Yogamaye Namaha”** — a powerful bija mantra invoking her divine energy  
>  
> Extended stutis invoke Yogamaya as:  
>  
> *"Shakti ki Ashta, tere charno mein sara sansar vandan"*  
> *(In your eightfold power, the whole universe prostrates at your feet)*  
>  
> *"Yogamaya Mata Tab Kripa Ki Varsha, Tujh Bin Thari Jivan Ki Uthar"*  
> *(Mother Yogamaya, then showers blessings; without you, life is an upheaval)* [3]

This mantra praises her **divine energetic aspects** and her merciful protection, crucial for spiritual awakening and mystical rites.

***

### Contextual and Scholarly Notes

- **Yogamaya** is understood as the personified internal potency of the Supreme Lord, responsible for cosmic illusions and divine causality in Vaishnavism and Sri Vidya traditions[4][2][5].
- She is described as assisting Krishna’s divine play (lilas) by manifesting Maya that protects and reveals transcendental truth, operating as an intermediary between **material illusion (mahamaya)** and **spiritual consciousness**[4].
- Her mantras and stutis form part of **mystical devotional ritual**—invoked in puja, daily japa, and meditative practices focusing on the cosmic creative power at the heart of Yogic philosophy[6][7].

***

### Recommended Further Classical Texts and Devotional Sources

- **Bhagavad Gita 7.25** — referencing the same potency veiling the ultimate truth  
- **Śrīmad Bhāgavatam Canto 10** — contains references to Yogamaya's role in Krishna’s pastimes  
- **Lalita Sahasranama** and **Devi Stotra compilations** — often call upon Yogamaya among divine feminine powers  
- Traditional *Yogamaya Stuti* recitations in Vaishnava ritual contexts [1][7][3]

There must be a significant body of triangulated scientific, engineering, visual art and aesthetic discourse and work on photic driving, trance induction and engendering entrainment with VJ digital illuminations: Please curate and report.

There is a significant body of scientific, engineering, and aesthetic discourse on photic driving, trance induction, and entrainment related to visual stimulation including VJ digital illuminations.

Photic driving involves rhythmic brain activity responses to visual flicker stimuli, measurable by EEG and MEG, showing frequency entrainment and resonance phenomena. Studies highlight photic driving at alpha frequencies can induce measurable brain entrainment, visual imagery, and altered states of consciousness (ASC). For example, exposure to flicker frequencies around 10 Hz can induce ASCs and promote vivid visual imagery, useful in trance and meditation contexts.

Scientific research has also explored the topographic brain response to photic driving across different frequencies, important for understanding functional states and potential clinical applications. The psychological impacts include increased visual imagery and altered mood states such as increased alertness and decreased physiological arousal.

In the context of visual performance such as VJing, the entrainment effects of dynamic digital illuminations and patterned flickering lights tap into this neurophysiological basis. These light patterns can induce trance-like states and entrainment in audiences by synchronizing neural oscillations rhythmically to the visual stimuli.

The interplay among these domains—neuroscientific bases of photic entrainment, engineering of rhythmic light displays, and the artistic practice of VJing—forms a complex multidisciplinary discourse. Research reports document how intermittent photic stimulation can generate brainwave entrainment, which can be harnessed artistically for trance induction and enhanced immersive audiovisual experiences.

Key references include neurological studies on photic driving responses and altered states of consciousness, psychological impact analyses of flicker stimulation on mood and imagery, and technical explorations of the frequency and pattern characteristics that maximize entrainment and resonance in the human brain.

Thus, the combined scientific, psychological, engineering, and artistic literature supports the use of rhythmic, patterned digital illuminations as powerful tools to induce trance states and entrainment, which lie at the core of VJ digital illumination practices aiming to foster immersive, altered experiential states [1][3][7][9].

1. Salchow et al. (2016), "Rod Driven Frequency Entrainment and Resonance in Visual Cortex": This scientific monograph published in PMC elaborately investigates photic driving under scotopic conditions. It provides a deep exploration into frequency entrainment, resonance, and spatial patterns in brain oscillations evoked by rhythmic light stimulation, revealing rod-dominated visual input dynamics and brain synchronization mechanisms central to entrainment effects [1][2].

2. Nguyen et al. (2017), "Entrainment of visual steady-state responses is modulated by global spatial properties of visual input": This watershed article explains how neuronal entrainment strength during photic driving varies with visual stimulus properties such as spatial frequency content, with implications for optimizing rhythmic stimulation in both research and applied settings (e.g., VJ digital illuminations) [3].

3. Historical and foundational research tracing back to Adrian and Matthews' 1934 discovery of photic driving, further surveyed in comprehensive reviews such as the Audio-Visual Entrainment history and physiological mechanisms article by Glicksohn et al., which contextualizes brainwave entrainment benefits and physiological underpinnings related to flicker-induced trance and imagery states [4].

4. Takahashi (1979), "Influence of red light and pattern on photic driving," addressing clinical and experimental observations of stimulus characteristics fostering photic driving responses across epileptic and healthy populations, essential for understanding safety and effect modulation in entrainment applications [5].

5. Oppermann et al. (2025), "Characterization of transient events during intermittent photic driving," offering cutting-edge insights into single-trial EEG dynamics, elucidating transient bursts underlying averaged entrainment signals, advancing the neuroscientific basis for individualized and dynamic photic trance induction [6].

Together, these works represent a firm scholarly foundation for understanding photic driving's neurophysiological mechanisms, clinical relevance, and artistic applications such as trance induction and rhythmic digital illuminations in VJ performance. They collectively triangulate findings across neuroengineering, neuroscience, psychology, and visual arts domains to enable scientifically informed and aesthetically resonant application of flicker and entrainment methods.
