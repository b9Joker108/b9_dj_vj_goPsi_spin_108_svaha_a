**Purport:** This English Wikipedia article was created, populated and cited by me and hasn't changed significantly from my foundational finesse. When I first created it, I wrote and populated it from my general knowledge for circa twenty (20) hours straight, whilst in a trance. I have had an enduring interest in trance induction andvtrance induction modalities. One of my personal heros is the luminary [Erickson](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milton_H._Erickson&oldid=1299500123).

**Personal Note: My trance induction powerpoints are to be on-point.**

For my soon to commence YouTube upload campaign I need to apprise myself of SOTA FOSS VJ applications on GNU/Linux and SOTA sophisticated sovereign FOSS video editing, stylistics, remixology, input masks and other sophisticated mystical Process Art magico-intentional post-processing mechanisms, techniques and modalities. Triangulate and report.

Can you find a traditionally attested verse or mantra to Sri Yogamaya please?

A traditionally attested verse and mantra dedicated specifically to **Sri Yogamaya**—the divine personification of Lord Vishnu’s illusory, internal potency (yogamāyā)—is found in classical Vaishnava scriptures such as the **Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (Bhāgavata Purāṇa)** and Vedic texts referencing the Supreme Lord's potency.

***

### Traditional Verse from Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (Canto 5 excerpt):

> **“nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam”**  
>  
> *Translation:*  
> "I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them, I am covered by My eternal creative potency (yogamāyā); and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible."  
> — *Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 1.2.18* [1][2]

This verse reveals Yogamaya as the **eternal creative potency**, veiling the Supreme Truth from the unenlightened, embodying the divine illusion yet power to manifest and transcend.

***

### Traditional Sri Yogamaya Mantra (from devotional stotra traditions):

A commonly chanted invocation to Yogamaya, often found in **Yogamaya stuti (praise) and hymns**, includes repetitive **beej mantras** and salutations invoking her blessings for spiritual purity, auspiciousness, and mystical power:

> **“Om Yogamaye Namaha”** — a powerful bija mantra invoking her divine energy  
>  
> Extended stutis invoke Yogamaya as:  
>  
> *"Shakti ki Ashta, tere charno mein sara sansar vandan"*  
> *(In your eightfold power, the whole universe prostrates at your feet)*  
>  
> *"Yogamaya Mata Tab Kripa Ki Varsha, Tujh Bin Thari Jivan Ki Uthar"*  
> *(Mother Yogamaya, then showers blessings; without you, life is an upheaval)* [3]

This mantra praises her **divine energetic aspects** and her merciful protection, crucial for spiritual awakening and mystical rites.

***

### Contextual and Scholarly Notes

- **Yogamaya** is understood as the personified internal potency of the Supreme Lord, responsible for cosmic illusions and divine causality in Vaishnavism and Sri Vidya traditions[4][2][5].
- She is described as assisting Krishna’s divine play (lilas) by manifesting Maya that protects and reveals transcendental truth, operating as an intermediary between **material illusion (mahamaya)** and **spiritual consciousness**[4].
- Her mantras and stutis form part of **mystical devotional ritual**—invoked in puja, daily japa, and meditative practices focusing on the cosmic creative power at the heart of Yogic philosophy[6][7].

***

### Recommended Further Classical Texts and Devotional Sources

- **Bhagavad Gita 7.25** — referencing the same potency veiling the ultimate truth  
- **Śrīmad Bhāgavatam Canto 10** — contains references to Yogamaya's role in Krishna’s pastimes  
- **Lalita Sahasranama** and **Devi Stotra compilations** — often call upon Yogamaya among divine feminine powers  
- Traditional *Yogamaya Stuti* recitations in Vaishnava ritual contexts [1][7][3]

There must be a significant body of triangulated scientific, engineering, visual art and aesthetic discourse and work on photic driving, trance induction and engendering entrainment with VJ digital illuminations: Please curate and report.

There is a significant body of scientific, engineering, and aesthetic discourse on photic driving, trance induction, and entrainment related to visual stimulation including VJ digital illuminations.

Photic driving involves rhythmic brain activity responses to visual flicker stimuli, measurable by EEG and MEG, showing frequency entrainment and resonance phenomena. Studies highlight photic driving at alpha frequencies can induce measurable brain entrainment, visual imagery, and altered states of consciousness (ASC). For example, exposure to flicker frequencies around 10 Hz can induce ASCs and promote vivid visual imagery, useful in trance and meditation contexts.

Scientific research has also explored the topographic brain response to photic driving across different frequencies, important for understanding functional states and potential clinical applications. The psychological impacts include increased visual imagery and altered mood states such as increased alertness and decreased physiological arousal.

In the context of visual performance such as VJing, the entrainment effects of dynamic digital illuminations and patterned flickering lights tap into this neurophysiological basis. These light patterns can induce trance-like states and entrainment in audiences by synchronizing neural oscillations rhythmically to the visual stimuli.

The interplay among these domains—neuroscientific bases of photic entrainment, engineering of rhythmic light displays, and the artistic practice of VJing—forms a complex multidisciplinary discourse. Research reports document how intermittent photic stimulation can generate brainwave entrainment, which can be harnessed artistically for trance induction and enhanced immersive audiovisual experiences.

Key references include neurological studies on photic driving responses and altered states of consciousness, psychological impact analyses of flicker stimulation on mood and imagery, and technical explorations of the frequency and pattern characteristics that maximize entrainment and resonance in the human brain.

Thus, the combined scientific, psychological, engineering, and artistic literature supports the use of rhythmic, patterned digital illuminations as powerful tools to induce trance states and entrainment, which lie at the core of VJ digital illumination practices aiming to foster immersive, altered experiential states [1][3][7][9].
