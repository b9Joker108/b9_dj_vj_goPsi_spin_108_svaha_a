During a photography gig during the late ’80s, Adem was first introduced to analogue and digital video art during Future Films production of the ground-breaking music video clips by Director Jeff Jaffers for Max Q, then soon after for Best Video ARIA nomination for Third Eye.

That cultural and creative impetus saw Adem gravitatefurther toward [the] cutting edgeexperimental digital art with a fervour, initially via the legendary Amiga-500 computer and analogue video-feedback.

Then expanding his visual repertoire to incorporate lighting and laser; fusing these mediums into dynamic illuminated projection designs for the Psy-Harmonics, Every Picture Tells a Story and Earthdance, Pure raves, the RPL, EGA, Big Day Out, Earthcore and Rainbow Serpent bush-doofs and festivals, as well as internationally for Infinite Frequency (LA), Tsunami (NYC) and Detroit Movement dance parties and festivals; including a Laser op residency at the established Machine monthly techno night.

Adem’s works embody and explore exo/esoteric concepts infused within the psychedelic, spiritual, scientific, and socio-political and cultural paradigms that the highly influential Cyber and Rave culture had originally embraced – yet are still relevant today. He has also been invited to exhibit print works in various exhibitions.

In collaboration with Cyber Dada and Don’t Shoot the Messenger, Adem was a seminal figure in the creation of the experimental Cyberthon video-art live-to-air broadcast events held at the RMITV studios, continueingat the TVU’s pop-up TV broadcast warehouse during the early to mid-’90s. The complete Cybertron original mastered recordings have recently been digitised into the ACMI archives -Adem’s key involvement portrayed within VICE Magazine’s documentary and article, and in the Techno Shufflebook by Paul Fleckney.
	
From the mid to late nineties onward Adem also ventured into commercial-art, beginningas a 3D animator, then specialising in Compositing for TV series, TV adverts, Music Videos, Documentaries, Feature Film as well as periodic Web-based media, Mobi-sodes and GamingCinematics for boutique studios such Unreal Pictures, Mirage and Liquid VFX..

Adem has continued to make music videos and perform VJ mixes for various festivalevents,live-streams, and live acts such as Carl Cox, Taipan Tiger Girls (feat. Ollie Olsen), Juno Reactor,My Friend the Chocolate Cake (feat. David Bridie) and Monolake(Robert Henke). One highlight being a collaboration with Projection Teknik (Nick Azidis) in creating the 360-degree animation White Night presentation of Ideation, projection-mapped over the State Library of Victoria’s La Trobe Reading Room.
